Hire product feature
--------------------

Some products are for sale and some more expensive products are for hire only, to start with we can simplify that products are available for daily rental so each instance of a product is its own asset which will have its own calendar of availability.

With regards to a sales order line for a hire product the quantity will reflect the days that it is going to be hired. Hence the adding to basket needs to identify which days it is being hired and that it is available as an asset can only be in one place at a time.

This needs to be implemented as a different product page for hired products to show availability before being added to sales order.
