# Sales Order Generation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete Amazon-style e-commerce shopping flow with product browsing, cart management, checkout, and order creation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Models & Types
Created TypeScript types in `src/types/index.ts`:
- `SalesOrder` - Sales order header with customer, dates, status, payment/shipping info
- `SalesOrderLine` - Order line items with product, quantities, and status
- `CartItem` - Shopping cart item with product and quantity
- `Cart` - Shopping cart with items and total
- `SalesOrderWithLines` - Complete order with line items
- Updated `Product` type to include `price` field

### 2. Mock Data & API
- **Mock Data**:
  - `src/mocks/data/salesOrders.ts` - Sample sales orders and lines
  - Updated `src/mocks/data/products.ts` with prices and additional products

- **MSW Handlers** (`src/mocks/handlers.ts`):
  - Cart operations: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for cart management
  - Sales orders: GET list, GET by ID, POST create, PATCH update status
  - In-memory cart storage with automatic total calculation

- **API Services**:
  - `src/services/api/cart.ts` - Cart management API client
  - `src/services/api/salesOrders.ts` - Sales order API client

### 3. State Management
- **CartContext** (`src/contexts/CartContext.tsx`):
  - Global cart state management
  - Methods: addToCart, updateQuantity, removeItem, clearCart, refreshCart
  - Integrated into App.tsx via CartProvider

### 4. User Interface Pages

#### Products List (`src/pages/Products.tsx`)
- Product grid with search functionality
- Category filtering
- Add to cart from list view
- Navigate to product details

#### Product Detail (`src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx`)
- Full product information display
- Quantity selector with +/- controls
- Add to cart or Buy Now (adds to cart and navigates to checkout)
- Product specifications and pricing

#### Shopping Cart (`src/pages/Cart.tsx`)
- View all cart items
- Adjust quantities inline
- Remove individual items
- Clear entire cart
- Order summary with total
- Proceed to checkout

#### Checkout (`src/pages/Checkout.tsx`)
- Customer selection dropdown
- Display customer contact info and shipping address
- Delivery options:
  - Requested delivery date picker
  - Shipping method (Standard, Express, Overnight)
- Payment terms selection (Net 30/60, COD, Prepaid)
- Order summary sidebar
- Place order button (creates sales order and clears cart)

#### Order Confirmation (`src/pages/OrderConfirmation.tsx`)
- Success message with order number
- Order details (dates, shipping, payment)
- Customer and shipping information
- List of order items with status
- Order summary
- Links to continue shopping or view all orders

#### Orders List (`src/pages/Orders.tsx`)
- View all sales orders
- Order cards with status badges
- Key information: amount, delivery date, shipping, payment
- Navigate to order details

### 5. Navigation & Routing
- **Menu** (`src/config/menu.ts`):
  - Added "Shop" (products list)
  - Added "Cart"
  - Added "Orders"

- **Routes** (`src/Router.tsx`):
  - `/products` - Product list
  - `/products/:id` - Product detail
  - `/cart` - Shopping cart
  - `/checkout` - Checkout process
  - `/orders` - Orders list
  - `/orders/:id` - Order confirmation/detail

### 6. UI Components
Utilized shadcn/ui components:
- Card, Button, Input, Label
- Select (customer dropdown)
- RadioGroup (shipping & payment options)
- Dialog, Tabs (existing)

## Features Implemented

### Shopping Flow
1. ✅ Browse products with search and category filters
2. ✅ View detailed product information
3. ✅ Add products to cart with quantity selection
4. ✅ Manage cart (view, update quantities, remove items)
5. ✅ Select customer and shipping address
6. ✅ Choose delivery date and shipping method
7. ✅ Select payment terms

10. ✅ Browse all orders

### Data Flow
- Cart stored in MSW in-memory storage (simulates session)
- Orders persisted in MSW in-memory storage
- Automatic cart clearing after order creation
- Order lines created from cart items with proper pricing

### Status Management
Orders support multiple statuses:
- pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered, cancelled

Order lines support statuses:
- pending, allocated, shipped, delivered

## Technical Notes
- All components use TypeScript with proper typing
- Mock API provides realistic delays (200-500ms)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Cart context prevents prop drilling
- Error handling throughout API calls
- Form validation in checkout process

## Testing
Build successful with no TypeScript errors. Application ready for development testing.
