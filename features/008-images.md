Images for products
-------------------

On the products page add an image to each card without increasing the card too much, it would be easier to maintain if the images were stored in an assets folder and if no image is available then a no image image is displayed

The images should also be displayed on order detail page next to the lines

Multiple images should be stored on the product detail page - one large and multiple smaller images in a carousel. When the smaller
images are clicked then this should enlarge to the larger image

please add instructions to add further images and the naming conventions to the read.me
