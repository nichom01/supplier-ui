Pricing Maintenance
-------------------

As pricing across many products is an arduous process, the easiest way to maintain is via spreasheet. The user process is as follows:

1. Download current default pricing into a spreadsheet
2. Make pricing amendments onto spreadsheet
3. Upload updated spreadsheet
4. Update the default pricing for all records in the spreadsheet

The page should also show a list of the default pricing and allow you to update an individual record through the UI if required
